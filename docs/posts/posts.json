    "contents": "\r\n1. R-squared does not measure goodness of fit. It can be arbitrarily low when the model is completely correct\r\nI found this interesting because originally I thought that R-squared measured goodness of fit. R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. You can have a low R-squared value for a good model, or a high R-squared value for a model that does not fit the data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nR-squared tanks hard with increasing sigma, even though the model is completely correct in every respect.\r\nR-squared is always between 0 and 100%. 0% indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean. 100% indicates that the model explains all the variability of the response data around its mean. The higher the R-squared, the better the model fits your data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
